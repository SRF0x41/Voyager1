# Voyager-1 Computer (Working title)

**By Sergio Rodriguez**

## Introduction

*Voyager 1 is currently the farthest and fastest operational space probe. After concluding its flyby mission in 1980, it is now 15.6 billion miles away, continuing its journey beyond the Solar System into interstellar space. As of February 2025, its onboard computer system has completed 16,950 days of continuous uptime, with no expected shutdown until 2030, operating 42 years past its expiration date.*
